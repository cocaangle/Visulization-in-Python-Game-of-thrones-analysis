# game-of-thrones-analysis
Data sourced from Kaggle
These are some basic analysis about the dataset of game-of-thrones from Kaggle, the dataset is small but a little complex, which still need sometime to clean and explore the insight. Hope this analysis could be a reference for people who just learn data analysis in python for beginning:)
